# iDTech-ROB4-Jetson-2018
ROB4 2018 course content for Jetson

Welcome to ROB4 2018! Some goals this year include a wider range of robotics concepts and more student autonomy when developing new programs.

For last year's full GitHub repository, check here: github.com/iDTechHub/iD-Tech-ROB4-Jetson

Credit goes to Christian Turkoanje (aka Groot) for last year's content and the ROS install structure.

Updates needed to make the repository functional:
  All .sh and .cfg files must be executable
  Make CMakeLists.txt a symbolic link to /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake
  Chech that __init__.py.plain.in is in cv_bridge
